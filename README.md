# Dry Beans Classification & Price Prediction

Develop an automated method that predicts the value of a harvest from a ‘population cultivation’ from a single farm that has been presented at market. For each of the different varieties of white beans, you will be given the price per pound and the average number of seeds per pound.

You will be expected to take into account the differing costs of a mistake when you classify the seed varieties.
